nano is a very basic text editor that is available everywhere. 

Some important unix cmds: 

pwd: where are we in the file system

cd: change dir

ls: list the contents of the current dir

mkdir: make a new directory

rm: remove files and folders ** WARNING **

nano: text editors 

head: view top of file

tail: view bottom of file

less: page through a file

man: help page

ssh: -i [keyfile] [user]@[compute]

grep: finds everything

grep -c: count

^C: kill

^Z: sleep

^Q: quit

^X:exit

ps: process

Useful shortcuts:

The TAB key for autocomplete

the ~ for home area

the ../ for dropping to the main/parent directory

We will use a slight variant of this command in your favorite terminal application to access your EC2 instance via ssh - secure shell connection. This will be covered in detail in the next section (different lab page) but briefly here for completeness:

In your Terminal change directory to where you downloaded the private key file

cd ~/Downloads
Change the permission of the key file (make sure to use the name of YOUR key file here and not mine - it is unlikely that your name is also bjgrant ;-)

- Open an SSH client
- Locate your private key file. 
- Run this command, if necessary, to ensure your key is not publicly viewable.

chmod 400 "~/Downloads/bimm143_zoematsunaga.pem"

Now it is time to ssh into your EC2 instance with this key file - here use the command you copied from the web site previously (red box above), e.g.

# Use YOUR copied ssh command from above, e.g.
ssh -i ~/Downloads/bimm143_zoematsunaga.pem ubuntu@ec2-34-218-208-199.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com

To Copy: 
scp -i ~/Downloads/bimm143_zoematsunaga.pem ubuntu@ec2-34-218-208-199.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:/home/ubuntu/work/work/mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv results.tsv
