# Background

Today we will analyze some RNA Sequencing data on the effets of a common steriod drug on airway cell lines. 

There are two main inputs we need for this analysis:

-countData: counts for genes in rows with experiments in the columns. 
-colData: aka metadata, that tells us about the design of the experiment (i.e. what is in the columns of `countData`)

# Import countData and colData

```{r}
counts <- read.csv("airway_scaledcounts.csv", row.names=1)
metadata <- read.csv("airway_metadata.csv")
```

> Q1. How many genes are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(counts)
```


> Q2. Hoe many 'control' cell line sdo we have?

```{r}
sum(metadata$dex == "control")
```

# Toy differential gene expression

Let's try finding the average or mean of the "control" and "treated" columns and see if they differ.

- 1. First we need to find all "control" columns 
- 2. Extract just the "control" values for each gene
- 3. Calculate the `mean()` for each gene "control" values

```{r}
all(colnames(counts)==metadata$id)
```

The $dex column tells us whether we have "control" or "treated":

```{r}
control.inds <- metadata$dex == "control"
```

Extract jsut the "control" values for all genes

```{r}
control.counts <- counts[, control.inds]
```

Calculate the mean value for each gene in these "control" columns.

```{r}
control.mean <- rowMeans(control.counts)
```

> Q3. Do the same for "treated" to get a `treated.mean`

```{r}
treated.inds <- metadata$dex == "treated"

treated.counts <- counts[, treated.inds]

treated.mean <- rowMeans(treated.counts)
```

> Q4. Make a plot of `control.mean` vs `treated.mean`

```{r}
meancounts <- data.frame(control.mean, treated.mean)
head(meancounts)
```

```{r}
plot(meancounts)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(meancounts) +
  aes(control.mean, treated.mean) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3)
```

We totally need to log transform this data as it is so heavely skewed!

```{r}
plot(meancounts, log="xy")
```

```{r}
#TREATED/CONTROL

log2(20/20)
```

Doubling of the amount

```{r}
log2(240/120)
```

Half the amount

```{r}
log2(10/20)
```

A common "rule of thumb" is to focus on genes with a log2 "fold-change" of +2 as so called UP REGULATED and -2 as DOWN REGULATED

```{r}
log2(80/20)
```

Let's add a log2 fold-change value to our `meancounts` data.frame

```{r}
meancounts$log2fc <- log2(meancounts$treated.mean/meancounts$control.mean)

head(meancounts)
```

> Q. Remove any "zero-count" genes from our dataset for further analysis

```{r}
to.keep <- rowSums(meancounts[,1:2] == 0) == 0 
sum(to.keep)
```

```{r}
mycounts <- meancounts[to.keep,]
head(mycounts)
```

> Q. How many genes are "up" regualted at a log2fc threshold of +2?

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc >= 2)
```

> Q. How many genes are "down" regualted at a log2fc threshold of -2?

```{r}
sum(mycounts$log2fc <= -2)
```

**Hold on, we're missing the stats!**

# DESeq2 Analysis

Let's do this properly and consider the stats - are the differences in the means significant?

We will use DESeq2 to do this:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
```

The first function we will use from this package sets up the input in the particular format that DESeq wants:

```{r}
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~dex)
```

We can now run our DESeq analysis

```{r}
dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)
```

Peak at results 

```{r}
head(res)
```

# Result Figure: Volcano Plots

Plot of the log2FC vs P-Value

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, res$padj)
```

This P-value data is again heavily skewed so lets log transform it 

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, log(res$padj))
```

We can flip the y-axis by addign a minus sign. This will make it easier to interpret

```{r}
plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj))
abline(v=-2, col="red")
abline(v=+2, col="red")
abline(h=-log(0.05), col="red")
```

Let's add some color. 

```{r}
mycols <- rep("gray", nrow(res))
mycols[ res$log2FoldChange <= -2 ] <- "blue"
mycols[res$log2FoldChange >= +2] <- "blue"

mycols[ res$padj >= 0.05 ] <- "gray"

plot(res$log2FoldChange, -log(res$padj), col=mycols)
abline(v=-2, col="red")
abline(v=+2, col="red")
abline(h=-log(0.05), col="red")
```

```{r}
ggplot(as.data.frame(res)) +
         aes(log2FoldChange, -log(padj), col=) +
         geom_point(alpha=0.6, col=mycols) +
         geom_vline(xintercept = c(-2, 2), color = "red") +
         geom_hline(yintercept = -log(0.05), color = "red") +
         theme_bw()
         labs(title="Volcano Plot", x= "log2 Fold-Change", y="-log(Adjusted P-Value) ")
```

## We need to add gene annotation

Gene symbols and different database IDs

```{r}
res
```

We first need to add gene symbols (e.g. HBB, etc.) sp we know what genes we are dealing with. We need to "translate" between ENSEMBLE IDs that we have in the row names of `res`.

```{r}
head(rownames(res))
```

Install from bioconductor with `BiocManager::install("AnnotationDbi")`

```{r}
library(AnnotationDbi)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

What different database ID types can I translate between.

```{r}
columns(org.Hs.eg.db)
```

Let's "map" between "ENSEMBL" and "SYMBOL" (i.e. gene symbol)

```{r}
res$symbol <- mapIds(x=org.Hs.eg.db, 
                     keys=rownames(res),
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",
                     column="SYMBOL")

head(res)
```

Add a few more ID mappings including "GENENAME" and "ENTREZID".

```{r}
res$name <- mapIds(x=org.Hs.eg.db, 
                     keys=rownames(res),
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",
                     column="GENENAME")

res$entrez <- mapIds(x=org.Hs.eg.db, 
                     keys=rownames(res),
                     keytype="ENSEMBL",
                     column="ENTREZID")

head(res)
```

Let's be sure to save our annotated results to a file

```{r}
write.csv(res, file="my_annotated_results.csv")
```

## Pathway Analysis

Install the packages we need for pathway analysis: Run in your R console (i.e. not your Quarto doc!)
`BiocManager::install(c("pathview", "gage", "gageData"))`

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(gage)
library(gageData)
library(pathview)
```

Let's peak at the gageData

```{r}
data(kegg.sets.hs)
head(kegg.sets.hs, 2)
```

To run pathway analysis we will use the `gage()` function and it requires a wee "vector of importance". We will use our Log2FC results from our `res` object. 

```{r}
foldchanges= res$log2FoldChange
names(foldchanges) = res$entrez
head(foldchanges)
```

```{r}
keggres = gage(foldchanges, gsets=kegg.sets.hs)
```

What is in the returned `keggres` object

```{r}
attributes(keggres)
```

```{r}
head(keggres$less)
```

We can pass our foldchanges vector (our results) together with any of these highlighted pathway IDs to see how our genes overlap the pathway. 

```{r}
pathview(gene.data = foldchanges, pathway.id = "hsa05310")
```
